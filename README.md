# Open Containers Initiative Contributions

The [Open Containers Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/) (OCI) aims to define open
standards for container technology.  If you want to learn more about OCI, a good place to
start is the [Documentation](https://vsoch.github.io/man-opencontainers/docs/introduction/oci-types) 
base, or the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.opencontainers.org/faq) page.
The purpose of this repository is to help answer the question:

> How do I contribute?

Specifically, we want you to understand:

 1. What are the different OCI specifications, on an abstract level?
 2. What are applied usage examples of the specifications?
 3. How do I ask for help or clarification? 

Before posting an issue here, please read our [guide to contributing](https://vsoch.github.io/man-opencontainers/contributing). You might also want to understand how [the goals of each specifications](https://vsoch.github.io/man-opencontainers/docs/introduction/oci-types/) map to real world use cases. When you have this understanding, it naturally leads to how you can contribute!

 1. **Definition** You have a goal or need that is not addressed by a specification.
 2. **Documentation** An idea or concept is not explained enough for you to use it.
 3. **Feature Request** You have a new idea for an extension to a specification.

To serve these various contribution use cases, we have an [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/vsoch/oci-contribution/issues) with templates to guide you through the contribution process.
Each contribution request, whether it be asking a question or a feature, will happen via
discussion on the issue board. The final decision for a request might result in the opening of new
issues on other [opencontainers](https://www.github.com/opencontainers) boards, per the
collaborative discussion and decision of those involved. 

When you are ready, we have provided several templates to help guide you in your question, issue, or feature request. [Open an issue](https://www.github.com/vsoch/oci-contribution/issues) to get started with the process.
