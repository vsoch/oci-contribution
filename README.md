# Open Containers Initiative Contributions

The [Open Containers Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/) (OCI) aims to define open
standards for container technology.  If you want to learn more about OCI, a good place to
start is the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.opencontainers.org/faq) page.
The purpose of this repository is to help answer the question:

> How do I contribute?

Specifically, we want you to understand:

 1. What are the different OCI specifications, on an abstract level?
 2. What are applied usage examples of the specifications?
 3. How do I ask for help or clarification? 

From the above, it naturally leads to how you can contribute!

 1. **Definition** You have a goal or need that is not addressed by a specification.
 2. **Documentation** An idea or concept is not explained enough for you to use it.
 3. **Feature Request** You have a new idea for an extension to a specification.

To serve these various contribution use cases, we have an [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/vsoch/oci-contribution/issues) with templates to guide you through the contribution process.
Each contribution request, whether it be asking a question or a feature, will happen via
discussion on the issue board. The final decision for a request might result in the opening of new
issues on other [opencontainers](https://www.github.com/opencontainers) boards, per the
collaborative discussion and decision of those involved. 

Now that you have a high level understanding of this contribution framework, let's
tell you a bit about the specifications, and provide examples of how you might contribute.

## Understanding How Specifications Meet Goals

The core of OCI are the specifications for container images, registries (called "distributions") 
and runtime. Let's step back and talk about what this actually means. If you are a developer, as 
we discuss these specifications, think about them in the context of answering these questions:

 - How would I want to use this to solve a particular problem?

Specific examples will be given to help guide your thinking.
